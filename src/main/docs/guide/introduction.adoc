When this library is added to a Micronaut application, it creates the beans necessary to allow for the serialization and deserialization of XML. Both the client and server are supported in a similar manner to the standard support of JSON. Jackson is used to do the conversion of the XML to objects.

Because XML has no array boundaries, the entire request body must be buffered into memory before deserialization can occur. The standard request body size limits apply here as well.

Simply add the dependency to your Micronaut 1.3 or above project.

dependency:micronaut-jackson-xml[groupId="io.micronaut.xml"]
